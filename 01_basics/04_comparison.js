// console.log(2 > 0);
// console.log(2< 0);
// console.log(2== 0);
// console.log(2 >= 0);

// these all are giving value in boolean type beacuse we are comparing it is lesser or greater or equal to its stating datatype in true or false \


// console.log("2" < 0);
// console.log("2" > 0);

// in this string converted into number and after it is gving true or false value 

console.log(undefined = 0);
console.log(undefined > 0);
console.log(undefined >= 0);

// these type of conversion we can't do these are examples to understand the topic

// these are some comparisons between string into number undefined into number null into number and all are giving different type of values so we have to check everytime in diffrent types of data
